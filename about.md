### Why a Wiki for Robotics?
As practitioners, we believe that we are pioneering a new field.
Robots are inherently complex and require knowledge across numerous disciplines. This know-how takes time to develop.

Resources that exist are specialized and academic in focus. These frequently lack implementation details or instructions on applying the information provided.  These create a high-barrier of entry into the field.

To accelerate the development of both projects and individual skills, we need an applications-focused knowledgebase. A platform to share our knowledge, best practices, and lessons learned so that others may succeed.

*This* is that knowledge base. Here, you will find guidance on the full spectrum of our field.

### Where should I start?
This wiki is meant for people in various stages of their career, including absolute beginners. If you are just starting out in robotics, we recommend you to start from [Robotics Project Guide](wiki/robotics-project-guide/master-guid). This tutorial talks about what to consider and plan for in each step of a robotics project and provides ample resources.

### How can I contribute?

For simple edits, you can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RoboticsKnowledgebase/roboticsknowledgebase.github.io/blob/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Please see the [Contribute page](https://roboticsknowledgebase.com/docs) for more details.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
