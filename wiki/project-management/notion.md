title: Using Notion for Project Management
published: true
---

Effective project management is crucial to the long-term success of any project, and there are various free tools that small teams (3-8 members) can use to effectively manage their project.

This document explains how to use one such tool, Notion, for Project Management. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) is a documentation and task-tracking platform that can be significantly useful in managing different aspects of a project. The first half of this document details how to set up and use Notion for Project Management. The second half then introduces various project management strategies that teams can use to improve their project management process.

> The project manager’s role is to ensure that all aspects of the project are planned for and appropriately tracked throughout the life of the project. There should be at least one member in the team that assumes this role (could be in addition to other roles). 


## Setting up Notion for your team
Individual university students and teachers who associate their accounts with their school email addresses can get Notion’s Plus Plan for free. With this plan, one member in the team can host a teamspace which can be accessed and edited by upto 100 guests (Notion users). Here are the steps to set up Notion for your team: 

1. Create a Notion account with your educational email ID. 
2. Create a Notion team space. 
	- Inside your Notion workspace, click on the 'Settings and the members' option on the top-left of the window. 
    - Navigate to Teamspaces and create a new team space.  
3. Add team members to your new team space. 
	- Go to the home page of your team space.
    - On the top-right of the screen, click on the ‘Share’ button.
    -  Enter the email IDs of your team members and click ‘Invite’ to share the team space with them. Make sure the permissions allow invited members to access and edit the team space.
4. Each member invited should now have access to view and edit the team space. While this space is hosted on an individual’s Notion account, it is still a common team space which can be used by all members of the team (added as guests to the teamspace on Notion).

**Note:** The above method does not lead to a private teamspace on Notion. You will need to upgrade to Notion's premium plan in order to convert this to a private teamspace (only members can see the teamspace exists).


## Notion Project Management Template 
Here is a [simple Notion project management template](https://short-gatsby-680.notion.site/Dummy-Project-47645eb16177425d932332db325d0233?pvs=4) that you can use for your project. It contains the major sections that are needed to effectively manage your project. 
- To use the entire template in your project, just click on 'Duplicate' button on the top-right of the home page.
- To use a particular section of the template in your project, navigate to the section that you would like to use (for eg. Meeting Notes) and then click on the 'Duplicate' button on the top-right of the page. 
- When prompted where you would like to duplicate the tempalte to, just select your teamspace. 



### Meeting Notes
Maintaining a section for meeting notes is critical to project management. Details of major internal discussions within team members, or external discussions with project sponsors, users or other stakeholders should be documented in this section. An advantage of Notion is that it enables filtering and sorting meeting notes based on date, type or any other category that is used. Teams can use this feature to their advantage for quickly filtering out key information from a prior meeting. 

To effectively organize meetings on Notion, create a new page on Notion and select a Table template. Connect a new database to your Table where you can add meeting notes (example below). The Notion Project Management template shared above includes the meeting notes section as well. 
A standard meeting notes document should have the following indexing sections: 
- Meeting Date
- Meeting Participants
- Meeting Type

A standard meeting notes document should have the following content-sections:
- Meeting Agenda
- Meeting Notes
- Meeting Outcomes
- Action Items


Here is an example of maintaining meeting notes on Notion.

### Task List
Another critical aspect of project management is managing work and schedule. After completing the system design phase of a project, it is important to create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that includes all tasks that need to be completed to meet the project goals. On a shorter-horizon, these can be tasks towards a specific milestone / sprint. 

Notion makes it easy to track the progress of such tasks over time. It allows creation of task cards to be added to a Kanban board-type view, or simpy organized in a tabular form. A really useful feature here is that Notion enables filtering and sorting tasks based on date, type, assigned person or any other category that is used. Teams can use this feature to their advantage for quickly filtering out key information from a list of tasks. 

To effectively organize tasks on Notion, create a new page on Notion and select a Table template. Connect a new database to your Table where you can add tasks (example below). Similarly, add a Timeline section to automatically create the project schedule after adding tasks in the database. The Notion Project Management template shared above includes the task list section as well.
 
A standard task card should have the following indexing sections: 
- Assignee
- Start Date
- Due Date
- Type
- Status

A standard task card should have the following content-sections:
- Objectives
- Scope
- Evidence of Completion

Here is an example of tracking tasks on Notion:

### Project Schedule
Notion automatically converts your task list to a timeline format (Gantt chart). However, Notion can only do this to tasks that have a start date and end date defined. Additionally, you can edit the task list to add dependencies between tasks. 

Here is an example of managing a project's schedule on Notion -

### Documentation 
Like meeting notes and task management, documenting team ideas, decisions, observations and results is significant to successful project management. While a lot of information can be documented through meeting notes, the work that happens outside of meetings may be better documented in a separate document. Notion provides ample options to filter, sort and categorize your documents into various types and categories, so feel free to be creative when setting up your Documentation section. 

Here are some ideas for what you can document on Notion
- Meeting Notes (if not already a separate section)
- System Design documents
- System Testing documents
- Useful links and resources

To effectively document the above on Notion, create a new page on Notion and select a Table template. Connect a new database to your Table where you can add documents (example below). The Notion Project Management template shared above includes the task list section as well.


### Project Logs

Another form of documentation, like meeting notes and implementation / testing documentation are project logs. These are critical to managing the progress on a local basis, and can be a useful technique for members to structure their thoughts and observations in a common place. 

Here are some ideas for what you can log on Notion
- Individual Progress Logs
- Issues Log
- Risks Log
- Decisions Log

A project logs page can be created on Notion using the standard ‘Table’ template with a new database. The Notion Project Management template shared above includes the Project Logs section as well.


## Effective Project Management Strategies

### Weekly Meetings
Deciding and committing to specific meeting times every week is one of the first actions a team should take. Use Google Calendar (or MS Teams) to set up weekly meeting slots and invite all team members.

While every meeting could have a different set of agenda, the team should try to follow a common structure for each meeting. For example, every Monday meeting could start with a weekly progress update by each individual. Once individual progress has been recorded, the team can move on to team-level discussion / tasks. 

For a weekly progress update, here are a few questions the project manager should ask each team member:
- What were your tasks for last week? (cross-check with the task list)
- What are your tasks for next week? 
- Any concerns or obstacles that could prevent you from achieving your goals for next week?



### Card System for Latecomers

Coming on time to meetings exhibits qualities of professionalism and respect for other’s time. When managing student projects, it is especially important to ensure that team members are motivated and determined to start each meeting on time. 
Sometimes, a little incentive can go a long way. This is where the ‘Card System for Latecomers” can be a fun exercise for teams to try out. 

Here are the rules: 
- There are two cards – Red and Yellow.
- A yellow card leads to a 10-point penalty.
- A red card leads to a 20-point penalty.
- If a team member is 10 min late, they get a yellow card. 
- If a team member is 30+ min late, they get a red card. 
- Anytime a member gets 30 points, they have to sponsor lunch for the rest of the team. 

Feel free to modify the rules to suit your team’s interests!

This template acts as a tutorial on writing articles for the Robotics Knowledgebase. In it we will cover article structure, basic syntax, and other useful hints. Every tutorial and article should start with a proper introduction.

This goes above the first subheading. The first 100 words are used as an excerpt on the Wiki's Index. No images, HTML, or special formating should be used in this section as it won't be displayed properly.

If you're writing a tutorial, use this section to specify what the reader will be able to accomplish and the tools you will be using. If you're writing an article, this section should be used to encapsulate the topic covered. Use Wikipedia for inspiration on how to write a proper introduction to a topic.

In both cases, tell them what you're going to say, use the sections below to say it, then summarize at the end (with suggestions for further study).

## First subheading
Use this section to cover important terms and information useful to completing the tutorial or understanding the topic addressed. Don't be afraid to include to other wiki entries that would be useful for what you intend to cover. Notice that there are two \#'s used for subheadings; that's the minimum. Each additional sublevel will have an added \#. It's strongly recommended that you create and work from an outline.

This section covers the basic syntax and some rules of thumb for writing.

### Basic syntax
A line in between create a separate paragraph. *This is italicized.* **This is bold.** Here is [a link](/). If you want to display the URL, you can do it like this <http://ri.cmu.edu/>.

> This is a note. Use it to reinforce important points, especially potential show stoppers for your readers. It is also appropriate to use for long quotes from other texts.






#### Bullet points and numbered lists
Here are some hints on writing (in no particular order):
- Focus on application knowledge.
  - Write tutorials to achieve a specific outcome.
  - Relay theory in an intuitive way (especially if you initially struggled).
    - It is likely that others are confused in the same way you were. They will benefit from your perspective.
  - You do not need to be an expert to produce useful content.
  - Document procedures as you learn them. You or others may refine them later.
- Use a professional tone.
  - Be non-partisan.
    - Characterize technology and practices in a way that assists the reader to make intelligent decisions.
    - When in doubt, use the SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) framework.
  - Personal opinions have no place in the Wiki. Do not use "I." Only use "we" when referring to the contributors and editors of the Robotics Knowledgebase. You may "you" when giving instructions in tutorials.
- Use American English (for now).
  - We made add support for other languages in the future.
- The Robotics Knowledgebase is still evolving. We are using Jekyll and GitHub Pages in and a novel way and are always looking for contributors' input.

Entries in the Wiki should follow this format:
1. Excerpt introducing the entry's contents.
  - Be sure to specify if it is a tutorial or an article.
  - Remember that the first 100 words get used else where. A well written excerpt ensures that your entry gets read.
2. The content of your entry.
3. Summary.
4. See Also Links (relevant articles in the Wiki).
5. Further Reading (relevant articles on other sites).
6. References.

#### Code snippets
There's also a lot of support for displaying code. You can do it inline like `this`. You should also use the inline code syntax for `filenames` and `ROS_node_names`.

Larger chunks of code should use this format:
```
def recover_msg(msg):

        // Good coders comment their code for others.

        pw = ProtocolWrapper()

        // Explanation.

        if rec_crc != calc_crc:
            return None
```
This would be a good spot further explain you code snippet. Break it down for the user so they understand what is going on.

#### LaTex Math Support
Here is an example MathJax inline rendering $ \phi(x\|y) $ (note the additional escape for using \|), and here is a block rendering:
$$ \frac{1}{n^{2}} $$

#### Images and Video
Images and embedded video are supported.

![Put a relevant caption here](assets/images/Hk47portrait-298x300.jpg)

{% include video id="8P9geWwi9e0" provider="youtube" %}

{% include video id="148982525" provider="vimeo" %}

The video id can be found at the end of the URL. In this case, the URLs were
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P9geWwi9e0`
& `https://vimeo.com/148982525`.
