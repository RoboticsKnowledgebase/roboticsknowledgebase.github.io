This section is **not** an overview of machine learning (ML) techniques nor an introduction to the field of machine learning. Instead, it focuses on the **use cases of ML in robotics** and specific implementations where ML is applied to enhance robotic systems. From perception to decision-making, this section explores practical guides and real-world applications.

This section demonstrates how machine learning enhances robotic systems by enabling functionalities like object detection, natural language understanding, and decision-making. By focusing on specific implementations and integration techniques, it bridges the gap between theoretical ML concepts and practice.
