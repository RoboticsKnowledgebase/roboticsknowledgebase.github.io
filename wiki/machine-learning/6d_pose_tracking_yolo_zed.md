# 6D Pose Estimation with YOLO and ZED

## Initial Setup and Configuration

The first step in implementing 6D pose estimation involves configuring both YOLO and the ZED camera system. The YOLO configuration requires special attention to ensure it works effectively with pose estimation tasks:

```python
import torch
from ultralytics import YOLO
import pyzed.sl as sl

# Initialize YOLO model with custom configuration
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
model.add_callback('on_predict_start', lambda: torch.cuda.synchronize())

# Configure for pose estimation
model.overrides['conf'] = 0.25  # Detection confidence threshold
model.overrides['iou'] = 0.45   # NMS IoU threshold
model.overrides['agnostic_nms'] = True  # Class-agnostic NMS
```

In this initial configuration, we're setting up YOLO with specific parameters optimized for pose estimation. The confidence threshold of 0.25 is chosen as a balance between detection accuracy and false positives - lower values would catch more potential objects but increase false detections. The IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold of 0.45 determines how much overlap between bounding boxes is allowed before they're merged in the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) step. We enable class-agnostic NMS because in pose estimation, we care more about accurate bounding boxes than strict class separation. The CUDA synchronization callback ensures our GPU operations complete before moving to the next frame, which is crucial for accurate temporal tracking.

Next, we configure the ZED camera with parameters specific to pose estimation:

```cpp
sl::Camera zed;
sl::InitParameters init_params;
init_params.depth_mode = sl::DEPTH_MODE::NEURAL;  // Use neural depth
init_params.coordinate_units = sl::UNIT::METER;
init_params.depth_stabilization = true;

// Set up object detection parameters
sl::ObjectDetectionParameters det_params;
det_params.enable_tracking = true;
det_params.enable_mask_output = true;
det_params.detection_model = sl::OBJECT_DETECTION_MODEL::CUSTOM_BOX_OBJECTS;
```

The ZED configuration focuses on maximizing depth accuracy and stability. We specifically use NEURAL depth mode, which employs deep learning to enhance depth estimation accuracy, particularly crucial for precise pose estimation. The depth_stabilization parameter enables temporal smoothing of depth measurements, reducing jitter in our pose estimates. We set coordinate units to meters for real-world scaling, and enable tracking and mask output for better object segmentation and temporal consistency.

## Core Pose Estimation Implementation

The heart of our system is the pose estimation class, which combines 2D detections with depth information:

```cpp
class PoseEstimator {
private:
    sl::Mat point_cloud;
    sl::Mat left_image;
    
public:
    struct Pose6D {
        sl::float3 position;      // 3D position
        sl::float4 orientation;   // Quaternion orientation
        sl::float3 dimensions;    // Object dimensions
        float confidence;         // Pose estimation confidence
    };

    Pose6D estimate_pose(const sl::ObjectData& object) {
        Pose6D pose;
        // Extract 3D points within object bounds
        sl::float4 object_points[4];
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            float4 point;
            point_cloud.getValue(
                object.bounding_box_2d[i].x,
                object.bounding_box_2d[i].y,
                &point
            );
            object_points[i] = point;
        }
        pose.position = compute_centroid(object_points);
        pose.orientation = estimate_orientation(object_points);
        pose.dimensions = compute_dimensions(object_points);
        return pose;
    }
};
```

This PoseEstimator class implements our core pose estimation algorithm. For each detected object, we extract the 3D points corresponding to the 2D bounding box corners from the depth point cloud. These points serve as anchors for computing the object's pose. The position is calculated as the centroid of these points, providing a robust center point estimation even with partial occlusions. The orientation is estimated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the point cloud segment, which finds the principal axes of the object. This approach works well for objects with clear geometric structure but may need refinement for more complex or symmetrical objects.

## Velocity Tracking Implementation

The velocity tracking system is crucial for understanding object dynamics in real-time. Here's the implementation with detailed explanation:

```cpp
class VelocityTracker {
private:
    struct TrackedObject {
        uint64_t id;
        std::deque pose_history;
        sl::float3 linear_velocity;
        sl::float3 angular_velocity;
        timestamp_t last_update;
    };
    
    std::map tracked_objects;
    
public:
    void update_velocity(uint64_t object_id, const Pose6D& current_pose) {
        auto& tracked = tracked_objects[object_id];
        tracked.pose_history.push_back(current_pose);
        if (tracked.pose_history.size() > MAX_HISTORY_SIZE) {
            tracked.pose_history.pop_front();
        }
        
        if (tracked.pose_history.size() >= 2) {
            auto dt = compute_time_difference(
                tracked.pose_history.back(),
                tracked.pose_history[tracked.pose_history.size()-2]
            );
            tracked.linear_velocity = compute_linear_velocity(
                tracked.pose_history,
                dt
            );
            tracked.angular_velocity = compute_angular_velocity(
                tracked.pose_history,
                dt
            );
        }
    }
};
```

This VelocityTracker class maintains a history of object poses and computes both linear and angular velocities. We use a std::deque for pose_history to efficiently manage a sliding window of recent poses. The MAX_HISTORY_SIZE (typically set to 30 frames) helps limit memory usage while providing enough data for smooth velocity estimation. Each tracked object maintains its own history, allowing for independent velocity calculations even when multiple objects are present in the scene.

The velocity computation is triggered whenever a new pose is added, but only if we have at least two poses in the history. This ensures we always have a previous state to compare against. The time difference (dt) between poses is crucial for accurate velocity calculation and is computed using high-resolution timestamps.

Here's the detailed velocity computation implementation:

```cpp
private:
    sl::float3 compute_linear_velocity(
        const std::deque& history,
        float dt
    ) {
        const auto& latest = history.back();
        const auto& previous = history[history.size()-2];
        
        // Initialize Kalman filter parameters
        static KalmanFilter kf_x(1, 1, 0.001, 0.1);
        static KalmanFilter kf_y(1, 1, 0.001, 0.1);
        static KalmanFilter kf_z(1, 1, 0.001, 0.1);
        
        // Compute raw velocities
        float raw_vx = (latest.position.x - previous.position.x) / dt;
        float raw_vy = (latest.position.y - previous.position.y) / dt;
        float raw_vz = (latest.position.z - previous.position.z) / dt;
        
        // Apply Kalman filtering for smooth velocity estimates
        sl::float3 filtered_velocity;
        filtered_velocity.x = kf_x.update(raw_vx);
        filtered_velocity.y = kf_y.update(raw_vy);
        filtered_velocity.z = kf_z.update(raw_vz);
        
        return filtered_velocity;
    }
```

The linear velocity computation uses Kalman filtering to reduce noise in the velocity estimates. We maintain separate Kalman filters for each axis (x, y, z) because the noise characteristics might differ in each direction. The process noise (0.001) and measurement noise (0.1) parameters are tuned for typical indoor movement speeds - these values provide a good balance between responsiveness and stability.

## Performance Optimization

Efficient implementation requires careful attention to memory management and multi-threading:

```cpp
class PoseEstimationPipeline {
private:
    struct ProcessingQueues {
        ThreadSafeQueue detection_queue;
        ThreadSafeQueue pose_queue;
        ThreadSafeQueue velocity_queue;
    } queues;

    void detection_loop() {
        while(running) {
            if (zed.grab(runtime_params) == sl::ERROR_CODE::SUCCESS) {
                // Retrieve ZED images
                zed.retrieveImage(left_image, sl::VIEW::LEFT);
                zed.retrieveMeasure(point_cloud, sl::MEASURE::XYZRGBA);
                
                // Run YOLO detection
                auto detections = model.predict(left_image.getPtr());
                
                // Queue detections for pose estimation
                queues.detection_queue.push(detections);
            }
        }
    }
    
    void pose_estimation_loop() {
        while(running) {
            auto detections = queues.detection_queue.wait_and_pop();
            if(detections) {
                for(const auto& det : *detections) {
                    auto pose = pose_estimator.estimate_pose(det);
                    queues.pose_queue.push(pose);
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

This pipeline implementation uses a multi-threaded approach to maximize throughput. The detection_loop runs on one thread, continuously grabbing frames and running YOLO detection. The pose_estimation_loop runs on another thread, processing the detections as they become available. We use thread-safe queues to handle communication between threads, preventing data races while maintaining efficiency.
