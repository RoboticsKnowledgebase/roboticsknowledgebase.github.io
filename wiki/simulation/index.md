This section focuses on **simulation tools, techniques, and environments** for robotics applications. From lightweight simulators to full-scale dynamic environments like CARLA and Autoware, these articles provide insights into building, configuring, and optimizing simulators for various robotics use cases.

## Key Subsections and Highlights

- **[Building a Light-Weight Custom Simulator](/wiki/simulation/Building-a-Light-Weight-Custom-Simulator/)**
  Discusses the design and implementation of a minimal simulator for testing reinforcement learning algorithms. Focuses on simplicity, customizability, and minimal noise. Highlights considerations like minimizing external disturbances, reducing development effort, and maintaining a reliable architecture.

- **[Design Considerations for ROS Architectures](/wiki/simulation/Design-considerations-for-ROS-architectures/)**
  Provides a comprehensive guide to designing efficient ROS architectures for simulation and robotics. Covers critical aspects like message dropout tolerance, latency, synchronous vs asynchronous communication, and task separation. Includes practical tips for optimizing communication and node performance in ROS-based systems.

- **[NDT Matching with Autoware](/wiki/simulation/NDT-Matching-with-Autoware/)**
  Explains the Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) for mapping and localization in autonomous driving. Includes step-by-step instructions for setting up LiDAR sensors, generating NDT maps, and performing localization. Covers hardware and software requirements, troubleshooting, and visualization techniques using Autoware and RViz.

- **[Simulating Vehicles Using Autoware](/wiki/simulation/simulating-vehicle-using-autoware/)**
  Details the process of simulating an Ackermann-drive chassis in Autoware. Includes configuring vehicle models, adding sensors, customizing worlds in Gazebo, and using path-planning algorithms like Pure Pursuit and OpenPlanner. Explores sensor simulation and integration with existing ROS packages for enhanced functionality.

- **[Spawning and Controlling Vehicles in CARLA](/wiki/simulation/Spawning-and-Controlling-Vehicles-in-CARLA/)**
  A hands-on tutorial for spawning and controlling vehicles in the CARLA simulator. Covers connecting to the CARLA server, visualizing waypoints, spawning vehicles, and using PID controllers for motion control. Demonstrates waypoint tracking with visual aids and includes example scripts for quick implementation.
