The **System Design and Development** section provides comprehensive resources and guidelines for developing, integrating, and refining robotic systems. These articles emphasize best practices, methodologies, and tools to enhance system reliability, modularity, and performance.


## Key Subsections and Highlights

- **[Cable Management](/wiki/system-design-development/cable-management/)**
  Focuses on effective planning, creation, and installation of cables to ensure reliability, ease of debugging, and modularity in robotic systems.

- **[Hardware-in-Loop and Software-in-Loop Testing](/wiki/system-design-development/In-Loop-Testing/)**
  Discusses HIL and SIL methodologies for testing real-time embedded controllers, with specific use cases like ADAS and autonomous vehicles.

- **[Mechanical Design](/wiki/system-design-development/mechanical-design/)**
  Provides guidelines for mechanical system design, including modeling, stress analysis, modularity, and iterative design practices.

- **[PCB Design Notes](/wiki/system-design-development/pcb-design/)**
  Covers PCB design practices, including software tools, vendor recommendations, schematic guidelines, and manufacturing processes.

- **[System-Subsystem-Interface Modeling](/wiki/system-design-development/subsystem-interface-modeling/)**
  Introduces SysML-based system modeling to enhance planning, requirements tracing, and subsystem interaction design.
