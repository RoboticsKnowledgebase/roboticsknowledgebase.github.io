This section delves into **interfacing techniques and tools** for robotics applications, covering hardware-software integration, middleware communication bridges, and working with various sensors and actuators. This section provides practical guides and insights to streamline the integration of hardware and software components in robotics projects.

## Key Subsections and Highlights

- **[Blink(1) LED](/wiki/interfacing/blink-1-led/)**
  A practical guide to using the Blink(1) USB RGB LED for visual feedback and troubleshooting. Includes step-by-step instructions for setting up the LED on Linux, basic command-line usage, and integration with ROS nodes for monitoring states and providing visual indicators.

- **[micro-ROS for ROS 2 on Microcontrollers](/wiki/interfacing/microros-for-ros2-on-microcontrollers/)**
  Explores the use of micro-ROS to integrate low-resource microcontrollers, like the Arduino Due, into ROS 2 systems. Covers setup for both microcontroller nodes and host computer agents, with options for native installations or Docker containers. Includes examples of creating publishers, handling transient connections, and debugging techniques.

- **[Getting Started with the Myo](/wiki/interfacing/myo/)**
  A beginner-friendly tutorial for the Myo Gesture Control Armband, covering Lua scripting basics, API access, and available language bindings (e.g., Python, Java, ROS). Guides users through creating simple gesture-based applications and integrating Myo with larger robotic systems.

- **[ROS 1 - ROS 2 Bridge](/wiki/interfacing/ros1_ros2_bridge/)**
  A detailed walkthrough of setting up the ROS 1 bridge to enable communication between ROS 1 and ROS 2 environments. Discusses dynamic and static bridges, installation tips, and best practices for sourcing. Also includes guidance for Docker-based deployment and examples of bridging specific topics and services.
