# Quadrotors

Quadrotors, or quadcopters, are versatile aerial robots ideal for tasks like surveillance, mapping, and autonomous navigation. Their ability to hover and navigate 3D spaces makes them invaluable for inspecting hard-to-reach areas like rooftops or dense forests.

Compared to ground-based robots, quadrotors are more affordable and versatile, operating in diverse environments with ease. Open-source platforms like PX4 and Agilicious allow extensive customization, while pre-built options like DJI Tello offer quick deployment. They are supported by a robust ecosystem of tools and resources, making them accessible to beginners and researchers alike.

Quadrotors excel in scalability, from small indoor drones for swarming research to larger models for agriculture or delivery. With lower maintenance needs and greater mobility than ground robots, quadrotors provide an affordable, adaptable, and efficient solution for education, research, and real-world applications.

Despite their advantages, quadrotors come with notable disadvantages. Their limited payload capacity restricts them to lightweight sensors and cameras, making them unsuitable for tasks requiring heavy equipment. They are also inherently less stable in adverse weather conditions, such as strong winds or rain, which can compromise their performance and safety. Tuning quadrotors for optimal flight can be complex, as factors like motor calibration, weight distribution, and flight controller settings require precision. Additionally, their delicate components, such as propellers and frames, are prone to damage in crashes or rough handling, leading to frequent repairs. Battery life is another limitation, with most quadrotors offering relatively short flight times, requiring careful mission planning or frequent recharging

Without getting into the nitty-gritty details, the basic idea is - if you want to have an extremely customized quadrotor, you should use the PX4 Autopilot Platform. PX4 is an open-source flight control system that provides unparalleled flexibility, allowing users to design and implement custom hardware configurations, integrate specialized sensors, and modify flight algorithms. Its modular architecture supports a wide range of hardware, from small indoor drones to large outdoor quadrotors, making it adaptable to various applications.

Other open-source systems like ArduPilot also offer robust features and flexibility, but PX4 is often preferred for its focus on cutting-edge research and compatibility with advanced tools like ROS and Gazebo. While PX4 offers extensive customization, its complexity introduces a steep learning curve, requiring users to have a solid understanding of flight dynamics, embedded systems, and programming.

PX4 provides features like multi-platform support, advanced flight modes (autonomous, manual, and hybrid), and real-time data logging. It also integrates seamlessly with ground control systems such as QGroundControl, enabling intuitive mission planning and monitoring. With a strong community and extensive documentation, PX4 empowers researchers and developers to push the boundaries of aerial robotics while maintaining complete control over their systemâ€™s capabilities.

# Quadrupeds

Quadrupeds are agile, legged robots designed for tasks requiring rough terrain navigation, balance, and adaptability. Unlike wheeled or tracked robots, quadrupeds can traverse uneven surfaces, climb stairs, and recover from falls, making them ideal for search-and-rescue operations, construction sites, and even entertainment.

Quadrupeds excel in dynamic environments, offering unparalleled mobility and flexibility. Advanced control algorithms and robust mechanical designs enable them to adapt their gait and posture, ensuring stability in challenging conditions. This adaptability extends to various payload configurations, with some models capable of carrying heavy loads for extended missions.

Compared to wheeled robots, quadrupeds are generally slower but more versatile in unstructured settings. They are often equipped with sophisticated sensors like LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs, making them suitable for tasks like mapping, surveillance, and object manipulation. However, their mechanical complexity and reliance on advanced algorithms often result in higher costs and maintenance requirements. Additionally, their power consumption can be significant, limiting operational time unless supported by advanced battery technologies or external power sources.

When comparing quadruped robots like Unitree's Go1 EDU and Go2 EDU, Boston Dynamics' Spot, and ANYbotics' ANYmal, the Unitree models offer a compelling balance of customizability and affordability. The Go2 EDU, in particular, supports programming in Python and is compatible with ROS2, facilitating extensive customization and integration with various applications. In contrast, Boston Dynamics' Spot, while user-friendly and capable, relies on proprietary SDKs, which can limit advanced customization. ANYmal is designed for industrial applications and advanced research, offering robust API and SDK, but it comes at a higher price point. Regarding cost-effectiveness, the Unitree Go2 EDU is notably more affordable, starting at approximately 16,000 USD, making it accessible for educational purposes and research. In comparison, Boston Dynamics' Spot is priced between 74,500 USD and 94,500 USD, positioning it at a premium level.

# Wheeled Robots

Wheeled robots are efficient on smooth, even surfaces and are commonly used in indoor environments like warehouses, hospitals, and retail spaces. Their straightforward design and reliable locomotion make them an excellent choice for a wide range of applications, from material transport and inventory management to security surveillance and customer assistance. Wheeled robots are often favored for their simplicity and energy efficiency, allowing for extended operational times compared to legged or flying robots.

One of the key advantages of wheeled robots is their ease of control and maintenance. With fewer moving parts than complex robotic platforms like quadrupeds, wheeled robots are mechanically robust and cost-effective to build and repair. Their ability to carry significant payloads while navigating confined indoor spaces makes them indispensable in environments like hospitals, where precision and reliability are critical.

Wheeled robots also excel in scalability and modularity. Platforms such as TurtleBot and ROSbot are highly customizable, supporting a wide range of sensors, cameras, and computational units to suit specific research or operational needs. Their strong integration with open-source ecosystems like ROS (Robot Operating System) provides an extensive library of tools for navigation, perception, and interaction, enabling researchers and developers to prototype and deploy advanced robotic solutions quickly.

Although wheeled robots are primarily suited to flat, obstacle-free environments, their dependability and versatility make them a preferred choice for countless applications in industries that require efficient, repeatable tasks. From beginner-friendly educational robots to advanced platforms for research and development, wheeled robots are a foundational technology in modern robotics.
