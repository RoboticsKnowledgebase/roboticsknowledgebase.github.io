Selecting the appropriate simulator is a pivotal step in any robotics project. Simulators allow you to test algorithms, design robots, and visualize environments without the need for physical hardware, saving both time and resources. This section will guide you through the importance of simulators, help you identify the type of simulator that suits your project's needs, and provide comparisons of popular options across various categories.

By the end of this section, you will understand:  
- The significance of simulators in robotics projects and when to use them.
- How physics simulators work. 
- How to determine the type of simulator you require based on your project's specifications.  
- The pros and cons of various simulators tailored for robotics, machine learning/reinforcement learning, and visualization.  
- How to use a custom robot in a simulator.

## Why Are Simulators Important in Robotics Projects?

Simulators play a crucial role in robotics for several reasons:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Developing and testing in a virtual environment reduces the need for expensive hardware prototypes.  
- **Safety**: Allows for the testing of potentially dangerous scenarios without risk to humans or equipment.  
- **Accelerated Development**: Facilitates rapid prototyping and debugging, enabling quicker iterations.  
- **Accessibility**: Provides a platform for learning and experimentation without the necessity of physical robots.  
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent testing conditions, which is essential for algorithm validation.

Say that you want to deploy our quadruped robot `Tod` in a shopping mall. You already developed the software that will be running on `Tod` and integrated the peripheral hardware such as a camera for vision. But you're not sure whether everything will work nicely together when you actually put it into use. Will the perception work as intended and recognize obstacles? Will the planner output an optimal path based on the perceived obstacles and goal points? Will the controller move the robot as intended along the path given by the planner?

It's hard to tell, and you most certainly do not want to test this out for the first time in a crowded shopping mall! Here, a simulator can help. 
When developing a software component for your robot, you can use readily available open-source simulators to test out how your software might work in the real world. You can simulate the robot's behavior, such as the sensor measurements and controller gains, and also the environment, such as friction, gravity, wind, etc. Once you simulate the robot in this "fake world", you may detect some problems with your current software stack and choose to improve them. You can keep iterating this until you get the desirable performance.

## How do Physics Simulators Work?

Before we get into what simulators are out there for robotics (and ML/RL), we need to talk about how they simulate the world for our use. What makes them comparable (although not nearly identical) to the real world? 

The answer lies in **physics simulation**. Physics simulators like Gazebo and Isaac Gym provide a flexible and general-purpose framework for modeling a wide range of robotic systems. By representing robots as assemblies of rigid bodies connected by joints, applying appropriate constraints, and utilizing numerical integration methods, these engines can simulate complex dynamics without the need for hand-crafted equations of motion for each specific robot configuration.

### Fundamental Concepts of Physics Simulation

At the core of physics simulation are mathematical models that describe how objects move and interact. Key principles include:

**Generic Rigid-Body Framework**

At the core, modern physics engines treat any object—be it a part of a robot, a vehicle, or a drone—as a rigid body characterized by mass, inertia tensors, and geometry. The fundamental equations involved are the [Newton-Euler equations](https://resources.system-analysis.cadence.com/blog/msa2023-describing-rigid-body-dynamics-using-newton-euler-equations), which describe the translational and rotational motion of rigid bodies under applied forces and torques.

**Constraints and Joints Instead of Analytical Equations of Motion**

Rather than starting with a robot-specific analytical model, physics engines define robots as assemblies of multiple rigid bodies connected by joints and constraints. For example, a humanoid might be modeled as a series of rigid links connected by revolute and spherical joints, each with known mass properties. A quadrotor’s propellers, frame, and any jointed mechanisms are similarly represented as rigid bodies, with thrust and aerodynamic forces applied as external inputs.

The engine sets up a large system of equations representing:

- The motion of each body (Newton-Euler)
- The constraints imposed by joints and contacts (e.g., wheels on the ground, limbs connected to a torso)

These constraints ensure the bodies move in a way consistent with the defined mechanical structure (like a robotic arm’s linkage) or with environmental interactions (such as collisions and friction).

**Numerical Integration Methods**

To simulate the continuous motion of robots, physics engines employ numerical integration techniques to solve the differential equations governing dynamics. While classical integrators like Runge-Kutta (RK4) are possible, many physics engines prefer semi-implicit or symplectic integrators, and often use specialized iterative solvers optimized for stability and speed in real-time or real-time-like simulations. Common techniques include:

- Explicit Euler or Semi-implicit Euler: Very simple, often used as a first pass but may lack stability.
- Verlet integration or symplectic methods: Offer better energy conservation for certain problems.
- Constraint solvers (like Projected Gauss-Seidel or Sequential Impulse methods): Used to handle joint and contact constraints efficiently.

Off-the-shelf physics libraries (e.g., ODE, Bullet, DART, MuJoCo) typically blend these methods to achieve stable, real-time simulation. 

*Example: Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) Method*
Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) provides greater accuracy by evaluating the derivative at multiple points within each time step and combining them to estimate the next state. This method balances computational efficiency with precision and is widely used in simulations.

**RK4 Algorithm**: Given an initial value problem:
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0
$$

The RK4 method updates the solution as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
k_1 &= f(t_n, y_n) \\
k_2 &= f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_1\right) \\
k_3 &= f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_2\right) \\
k_4 &= f\left(t_n + h, y_n + h \cdot k_3\right) \\
y_{n+1} &= y_n + \frac{h}{6} (k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\end{align*}
$$

Here, $h$ is the time step, $t_n$ and $y_n$ are the current time and state, respectively, and $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$ are intermediate slopes used to compute the next state $y_{n+1}$. 

**Defining Robot Models with URDF**
Now, how do we pass in robot-specific information (settings) to simulators? We can do this via URDFs (in most simulators, at least).  
Users define the physical and kinematic properties of robots using formats like the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), an XML-based language. URDF allows users to specify:

- **Links**: Define the rigid bodies, including their geometry, mass, and inertia.

- **Joints**: Specify the connections between links, including joint type (e.g., revolute, prismatic), axis of rotation or translation, and limits.

- **Sensors and Actuators**: Describe additional components and their properties.

By providing this information in a URDF file, simulators can accurately construct and simulate the robot's behavior within a virtual environment.

![urdf_to_sim](/assets/images/robotics_project_guide/urdf_to_sim.png)
Here, the `"link"` in the red square on left-side is the URDF section that defines the Unitree G1's pelvis link. Based on the information provided here, the physics engine simulates the pelvis on the humanoid robot.   

**Extended Effects Through Plugins or Force/Torque Models**

For complex scenarios, users can enhance simulations by adding custom force models or plugins. For instance, to better simulate a quadrotor, a plugin might model propeller thrust and drag based on propeller speed. However, the underlying approach remains a numerical, constraint-based solution to the general equations of motion for rigid bodies.

This capability significantly speeds up reinforcement learning training times for robotics applications. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Determining the Right Simulator for Your Project

Before selecting a simulator, consider the following questions:

- **Integration with ROS/ROS2**: Does your project utilize the Robot Operating System (ROS)? If so, compatibility is essential.    
- **Physics Simulation**: Is accurate physics modeling necessary, especially for machine learning or reinforcement learning applications? Of course, accurate physics engine usually helps. But in some cases, it may suffice to just have a visualizer such as RViz or a low-fidelity physics engine.  
- **Customizability**: Do you require the ability to create custom models or environments? If you built the robot yourself, then you would most likely want a way to simulate your custom robot. Luckily, most simulators provide a way to do this. 
- **Budget Constraints**: Are there financial limitations that necessitate the use of free or open-source tools?  
- **Operating System Compatibility**: What platforms does the simulator support (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)?
- **Visualization Requirements**: Do you need photorealistic rendering for tasks like computer vision? Even when you use computer vision, the chances are that you wouldn't need photorealistic rendering. As long as the simulator can render the environment to a certain standard for object detection, it should suffice.
